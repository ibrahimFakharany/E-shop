Sure, here is the description for your GitHub project, edited and with markup language:

**This Node.js backend API is written in JavaScript using the Express framework. It provides a comprehensive REST API for managing a variety of business entities, including categories, brands, products, users, carts, coupons, reviews, orders, and favorites.**

**The API is secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). To authenticate, a user must provide a valid JWT in the HTTP header.**

**The API is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. To access it, you can use the following URL:**

```
https://<your-ec2-instance-ip-address>:<port>/
```

**Here is the list of all the modules in this API:**

* **Categories**
* **Brands**
* **Products**
* **Users**
* **Carts**
* **Coupons**
* **Reviews**
* **Orders**
* **Favorites**

**The project uses the following libraries:**

* **Express**
* **Dotenv**
* **Mongoose**
* **Slugify**
* **Express-async-handler**
* **Express-validator**
* **Nodemon**
* **Multer**
* **UUID**
* **Sharp**
* **JSONWebToken**
* **Nodemailer**
* **Compression**
* **Cors**
* **Morgan**
* **JWT**
* **Crypto**
* **Bcrypt**

I hope this description is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Here are some examples of markup language that I used in the description:

* **Bold** text is created by surrounding it with two asterisks (**).
* **Italic** text is created by surrounding it with two underscores (_).
* **Links** are created by surrounding the URL with angle brackets (< >) and adding the text to be displayed in parentheses. For example, this is a link to my website: https://www.google.com/.
* **Images** are created by surrounding the URL with an exclamation point (!) and adding the alt text in parentheses. For example, this is an image of a cat: Cat: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cute-cat.

I hope this helps!
